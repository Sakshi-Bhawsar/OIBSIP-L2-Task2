                    <h1>Missile Man of India </h1>
                    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015)
                        was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from
                        2002
                        to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                        engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at
                        the
                        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation
                        (ISRO)
                        and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                        efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                        ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
                        technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
                        original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

                    <h1>Early life and education</h1>
                    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                        pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the
                        State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local
                        mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that
                        took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited
                        Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
                        family.[His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
                        numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in
                        coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family
                        business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri
                        Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the
                        Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and
                        properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
                        poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to
                        the family's meager income.

                        Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence
                        Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft,
                        but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working
                        under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist He was interviewed and recruited into

                        (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                        where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
                        successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first
                        started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam
                        received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.</p>

                    <h1>The Demise of Abdul Kalam</h1>
                    <p>Abdul Kalam was a mortal human being just like us, but for his contribution to the country he
                        remained immortal in the hearts of people. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was one such personality who died
                        at
                        83. It was shocking news for the entire country as a pure soul left us forever. Abdul Kalam

                        he
                        suffered from a cardiac arrest and collapsed. Although he got admitted to the best hospital in
                        Shillong, the doctors could not save him.

                        attended
                        his funeral event and prayed for such a great soul.</p>
